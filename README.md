# Exam4Me

Student are always eager to find out their results the moment they complete writing theit exam or test. I decided to write this program in order to generate a simple examination simulator which could be used for a real examination results program.


##Class Diagram of the Domain Model

Below is the class domain diagram of the Examination Mark that I want to develop.

## Description of the Domain Model

As seen from the diagram the student and lecturer will both come from a faculty the difference between the two is that the lecturer will have the capabilities to upload the results and the student will then be able to download/view/print the results.

In order for the students to get their results they will need to write and examination as seen on the diagram. The student will write examination for a particular term and will be able to pull results for that term.

Only students who have paid all their fees will be able to recieve thier 4th term results. There are two types of students; Resident students and Non Resident students. The resident students have included fees such as meals and residential fees.
